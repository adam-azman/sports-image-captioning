# Sports Image Captioning Project

Welcome to the Sports Image Captioning Project! This project aims to automatically generate descriptive captions for sports images using advanced deep learning techniques. Leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with attention mechanisms for sequence generation, our model can capture the essence of sports moments and translate them into rich textual descriptions.
